== Description ==

Dan's Viewer for Google Drive was created when I was looking for a  way to share files via Google Drive on my sites, in a way that allowed downloading, viewing, exporting, and hardest to find, the ability drill down into subfolders without leaving the site. I couldn't find anything within my price range that fit what I needed, so I decided to create my own.

Dan's Viewer for Google Drive displays files in a way that is mobile friendly, customizable via shortcode, and easy to style. No need to import files or manage them directly in WordPress. All you need is a public Google Drive Folder (or multiple!) and a free, easy to get API key.

Features

* Displays public drive document listings in a mobile friendly format

* Offers both View and Download Options, where appropriate

* Offers Export Option for Google Docs / Sheets / Presentations

* All options are configured via shortcode

* Allows drill down / up within folders without leaving the page

* Ability to store and use unlimited Google Drive Folders

Shortcodes:

* Default Display `[dandrive]` (defaults to 1st drive)

* Optional Attributes Ex:`[dandrive drive=1 divid=mydrive height=400 width=300 rbutton=no]`

* drive= (number of the drive you want, defaults to 1 if not entered)

* divid= (id of the div your calendar is stored in, for custom theming. Defaults to random string to allow multiple per page)

* height= (maximum height in pixels, defaults to auto. If this is set, a scroll bar will appear if your div overflows. Enter a number only).

* width = (maximum width in pixels, defaults to 400. Enter a number only)

* rbutton = (no means don't display return to initial folder button. Omit to display (default behaviour))
